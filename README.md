# Arduino control system for Bluetooth-Powered LED Panel
This is half of the project that controls an interactive LED pixel art display. The code interprets inputs via Bluetooth from
the Frontend. These inputs range from drawing coordinates and color choices to mode settings and save requests.

[Please see LED-Canvas-Frontend repo for more info].
